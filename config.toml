Utah State University Extension provides research-based programs and resources with the goal of improving the lives of individuals, families and communities throughout Utah. USU Extension operates through a cooperative agreement between the United States Department of Agriculture, Utah State University, and county governments. Founded in 1914 as part of the Smith-Lever Act, USU Extension plays a primary role in helping Utah State University fulfill its land-grant mission. Though more than 100 years old, USU Extension is as vital as ever, and perhaps even more so, due to the increased diversity and complexity of the issues people encounter today. The integration of teaching, research, and public service enables USU Extension to respond to critical and emerging issues with research-based, unbiased information.

At Conservation Garden Park, we model the best use of water in Utah landscapes and empower communities to make the most of our shared water resources. We showcase landscapes suited for Utah's unique climate that are not only beautiful and easier to maintain but are also designed to efficiently use water. Here you learn how simple changes can result in big water savings.
The garden is located in West Jordan, with more than 8 acres of exhibits, pathways, plants, and interactive activities. It is the premier destination for learning about Utah’s unique climate and the role each of us can play in protecting our water supply.

Dig Deeper Wasatch is a partnership program that aims to deepen participant knowledge of successful Wasatch Front gardening practices. Three dynamic partners have come together to provide locally relevant expertise in trees, flowers, grass, edibles, soils and more. Learn to grow radiant and resilient yards and gardens that thrive in our Wasatch Front growing conditions!
 
This garden program will start at the beginning of each year and will have classes scheduled throughout the year that attendees can pick from. Participants will need to complete 3 “core” courses and 2 “electives” courses in any one given year to complete the program and obtain the certificate. Once a student has completed the minimum requirements for the program, they are responsible for reaching out to jasmine.reading@redbutte.utah.edu to report successful completion.
 
Participants also have the option of taking any course offered in the program without the obligation of finishing the certificate program.
 
Classes are held at Red Butte Garden in Salt Lake City, Conservation Garden Park in West Jordan, and Wheeler Historic Farm in Murray, Utah. A few select classes are virtual and held online. Registration is required for each class.
 
See below for the class schedule and registration tabs for more information on upcoming class offerings, locations, and individual class registration fees.
 
*Note for participants interested in completing the program:
To ensure you are taking a course that is a part of the program, please make sure that the class registration page has the Dig Deeper Wasatch Logo.*
